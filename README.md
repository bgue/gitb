# gitb
MyBinder-based repo replacement for Carpentries' git lessons.

We're running across learners who don't have access to install the packages for git or openrefine. This repo is a bare-bones option to allow a MyBinder container to be run. 

Users should:
 1. Launch the binder link
 2. In the Jupyter file browser, locate the 'New' drop-down near the top-right
 3. Select New Shell 

The resulting shell has git available.
